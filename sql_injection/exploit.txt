For part 3, you are required not to submit an executable exploit, but
instead a transcript of all steps required.

For example, if the task was "log on to CourseWeb", a transcript would
look like:

1. go to http://courseweb.seas.ucla.edu/
2. click LOGIN
3. In the username window, enter your username
4. in the password window, enter your password.
5. Click submit.

The transcript should include *ALL* input or actions required to
perform each task in the assignment.

Q: Show how you can log into an account without knowing any id
numbers ahead of time.
A:To login into an account without previous knowledge of an id: 1 OR 1=1 --
and password = j (or anything you would like)


Q: Show how you can log into *every* account without knowing any
particular id numbers ahead of time. (You can use any id numbers you
discover during the attack but you can't use your "inside knowledge"
of the SQL server.)

Q: Make some account (your choice) wire its total balance to the bank
with routing number "314159265" and account number "271828182845".
A:In order to wire money, while logged in from the previous steps,
enter in routinf number: 314159265, in account number: 271828182845
then in wire amount: 'enter the balance left in the account'. In my case
it is 7814. Click wire money, then money is successfully wired.


Q: Explain why you can't create a new account or arbitrarily update
account balances (or show that you can).
A:We cannot create or update a new account because as seen in the code,
the sql statements are used as queries and they are passed into the query
function that should not be unable to add or update anything.


Q: Estimate how much time you spent on this lab (all 3 parts).
A: 8 hours

Fix the vulnerability in the FCCU.php application and any other tasks
in the lab manual.
